## What is Dealbot?

  <div>

Dealbot hooks into Pipedrive and applies cadences to Deals when they hit certain stages. It's a very lightweight approach to sales automation.

### How is that different from SalesLoft, Outreach, etc.?

Those tools are way more powerful than Dealbot. Sometimes you don't need much. Plus you can't beat the price!

## Why Pipedrive?

  <div>

We've tried many CRM tools at [Faraday](http://faraday.io), and for our purposes, Pipedrive was the best. We've been known to call it the "Faraday of CRM": it's visual, intuitive, and honestly fun to use. Dragging a deal to the next stage just feels good when you find the right lead or get asked for a proposal.

### But why not Salesforce?

Salesforce is an incredible platform, but ultimately way more than we need for our 5-person sales team. With enough investment, you could turn your Salesforce instance into a personal Pipedrive and then some.
